# PCB Footprints

> A footprint or land pattern is the arrangement of pads (in surface-mount technology) or through-holes (in through-hole technology) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a printed circuit board. The land pattern on a circuit board matches the arrangement of leads on a component.

## How do I find them?

There are couple different ways to find PCB footprints. The first place to check is the manufacturer website, if they exists there, grab them. Next you'll want to check [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com) and [Sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com) by search for the part number. Lastly, head over to [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/) and see if you can grab it there.
